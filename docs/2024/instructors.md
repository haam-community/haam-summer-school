**Kyriaki 'Kakia' Anastasiadou** completed a MSc in Human molecular genetics from Imperial College London and worked for two years as a Laboratory Research Scientist, applying molecular protocols and automation to extract and sequence ancient DNA from skeletal samples. Currently she is a PhD student in ancient genomics at the Francis Crick institute, where she is generating and analysing ancient human genomic data from Britain.

**James Fellows Yates** is an archaeology-trained biomolecular archaeologist and convert to palaeogenomics, and is recently pivoting to bioinformatics. He specialises in ancient metagenomics analysis, generating tools and high-throughput approaches and high-quality pipelines for validating and analysing ancient (oral) microbiomes and palaeogenomic data.

**Selina Carlhoff** is a Postdoc in the population genetics group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. She did her PhD in 2023 at the MPI-EVA investigating "Human Archaeogenomics in Southeast Asia". Currently she is working on Iron Age sites in Central Europe. Additionally she is also a member of the MPI’s ethics committee.

**Krystal Tsosie** is an Indigenous geneticist-bioethicist and Assistant Professor at Arizona State University. She started her research career at the lab bench, but after seeing the disparities in emerging genomic technologies, she switched fields, completing two Master degrees: one in Bioethics at Arizona State University and another in Public Health (genetic epidemiology) at Vanderbilt University. 
Her current work focuses on Indigenous population genetics and bioethics, through community-based participatory research. She is a co-founder of the first US Indigenous-led biobank, the [Native BioData Consortium](https://nativebio.org/).

**Şevval Aktürk** is currently a first-year PhD student in the Bioinformatics Department at Hacettepe University. She completed her master's in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Middle East Technical University. In her master study, she simulated ancient genomes to assess the reliability of genetic relatedness estimation tools. Her doctoral research centres on analyzing time-series ancient human and microbial DNA data to understand the factors that shape the oral microbiome composition of individuals from Anatolia over a period of 7000 years.

**Bárbara Sousa da Mota** completed her undergraduate and master's degrees in physics in Portugal, where she is from. She is currently finishing her PhD, during which she worked on imputation of ancient genomes and on the genomic history of the Rapanui, the indigenous people of Easter Island.

**Harald Ringbauer** is a PI at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. As computational Archeogeneticist he develops and applies models to infer biological relatedness, past cultural practices, and population structure from DNA sequence data. Known software he developed are, for example hapROH and ancIBD, which detects shared haplotypes between pairs of ancient individuals. His tools are becoming widely adopted and really are door opening in terms of relationship analysis in ancient DNA.

**Stephan Schiffels** is a PI at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. His research group at the MPI investigates human history by means of Genetics, and develops computational methods to model and analyse ancient and modern genomic data.

**Clemens Schmid** is PhD student in the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Max Planck Institute for Geoanthropology. He is working with computational methods for the spatiotemporal interpolation and analysis of archaeological, linguistic and ancient genomic data. In the past he went through professional training in prehistoric, historic and scientific archaeology as well as computer science, worked in various research projects mostly in the European Neolithic and Metal Ages and developed multiple open‑source software tools in and around archaeology, like POSEIDON or MOBEST.

<!-- AYSHIN -->

**Jazmin Ramos-Madrigal** is an evolutionary biologist interested in tracing the evolution of plant and animal species through domestication using palaeogenomics. She is an assistant professor at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen.
Her work focuses on the study of the evolutionary processes that gave rise to domesticated species and the role that the root microbiome played in plant adaptation during domestication.

**Robert Maier** is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, which partners with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He completed his PhD in quantitative genetics at the University of Queensland (Australia) in 2017, where he worked on developing and applying genetic risk prediction methods. His current focus is on using genetic data to characterize correlated phenotypes better. He is one of the developers of Admixtools2.
