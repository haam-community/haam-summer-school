# HAAM Summer School - 2025

## Latest

Applications for the 2025 HAAM Summer school are now **closed**!

We had more than 120 applications. Thank you for your interest :D


## What

The **HAAM Summer School** is a 3 day workshop, with a mix of theoretical and practical sessions. Our Summer School covers different aspects of human ancient DNA (aDNA) research, including both technical and ethical challenges, and considerations when working with human skeletal remains and human genetic data.
The Summer School is held in a 100% virtual format to maximise accessibility and inclusivity for attendees worldwide, particularly for those working in lower-income countries and/or with limited funding, and to ensure that all participants can have equal access to content and interactions, as well as any network opportunities that could stem from the summer school, regardless of where they are based. 
The course was planned by active researchers of the HAAM-community (including The Francis Crick Institute (UK), MPI-EVA (DE), Globe Institute (DK), University College Dublin (IE) & University of Zurich (CH)). Instructors of the course are volunteers teaching during the period of the Summer School. The summer school is supported by Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, [Adelphi Genetics Forum](https://adelphigenetics.org/) and the [International Society of Biomolecular Archaeology](https://www.isbarch.org/)

## Where

We are running this virtual edition of the HAAM Summer School on **Gather.Town**, on the [HAAM workspace](https://app.gather.town/events/eozSbSqyTOeSmmVNyvBX).

If you're not familiar with this platform please see the documentation on the gather.town website, or [this 'Quick Start' video from nf-core](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown).

> ⚠️ If you're using Mac/OSX we highly recommend using the desktop app of gather.town rather than your web browser, for optimisation purposes.

## How

You will need access to the internet, and a modern web browser - either Google Chrome, Chromium or Microsoft Edge.
Firefox, is also possible, but makes copy-pasting difficult (you will need to press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> a lot...). Safari isn't recommended.

Each participant will being given a cloud computing node kindly provided by the German [deNBI infrastructure](https://www.denbi.de/cloud) for the duration of the summer school.

Registration links will be sent via email all participants, however detailed instructions on registration procedure can be seen [here](2024/denbi-registration).

Once you've received your link, each participant will need to open the link in their browser. On the Guacamole page please use the username/password und 'Login credentials' [here](https://simplevm.denbi.de/wiki/simple_vm/customization/#apache-guacamole). You should then see a desktop environment.

If you get a message about permissions for 'colour management', please use the password described for the 'Username' in the next code block below the 'Login Credentials' in the instructions above.
