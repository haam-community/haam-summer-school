**Bárbara Sousa da Mota**: Originally from Portugal, Bárbara studied physics for her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Porto and Lisbon, respectively. After modelling wildfire propagation for her master’s thesis, she moved to the University of Lausanne to pursue a PhD in the field of quantitative biology under the supervision of Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas and Olivier Delaneau. There, she assessed how imputation tools and resources can reliably be applied in the field of ancient human DNA, and analysed ancient genomes to unravel some key aspects of the history of the Rapanui, the indigenous people of Easter Island. Bárbara has recently started working as a postdoctoral researcher in David Reich’s research group at Harvard University.  She will teach a theoretical session on imputation of aDNA.

**Catherine Frieman** (@cjfrieman.bsky.social) is an Associate Professor of European Archaeology at ANU. Her work explores innovation, resistance, feminist theory, and ancient tech, especially stone tools. She writes on the politics of archaeology and the ethical challenges of ancient DNA, “using the past to imagine more just futures”. Catherine’s research team is based at ANU and serves as an editor at Current Anthropology.

**Éadaoin Harney** (@eadaoinharney.bsky.social) is a scientist on the Population Genetics R&D team at 23andMe, Inc. and a lecturer in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. She has worked in the field of ancient DNA for over a decade, and has experience in both wet lab and computational approaches. Her current research focuses on using ancient DNA methodologies to identify genetic connections between historical individuals and research participants in 23andMe’s massive genetic database. She earned her PhD in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology from Harvard University in 2020, where she was co-advised by David Reich and John Wakeley. Her work integrates allele frequency based approaches (like qpAdm) and identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis to study migration, admixture, and relatedness across time. She will be teaching on the interpretation of qpAdm and IBD.

**Eirini Skourtanioti** is a postdoctoral researcher at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), specializing in ancient human genomics and its integration with historical and bioarchaeological evidence. Her research focuses on the population history of the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia, with particular interest in admixture, natural selection, biological kinship, and marital practices in the past.
At LMU, she analyses intra- and inter-cemetery genomic data to explore fine structure and kinship dynamics aiming to deepen our understanding of social organisation and demographic processes in ancient Greece.

**Emily Breslin** (@emily-brez.bsky.social) is a postdoctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin. Her work focusses on the demographic history of populations in west Europe from the Palaeolithic to the Iron Age. She is interested in how methods such as genotype imputation can be applied to maximise the information retrieved from low-coverage genomes.

**Harald Ringbauer** is a population geneticist developing computational tools to study ancient human DNA. He leads a research group at MPI-EVA Leipzig, exploring past population and social structures through ancient genomes. He has developed tools such as HapROH or ancIBD. 

**James Fellows Yates** is a postdoc at the MPI bridging ancient DNA and bioinformatics. He co-founded SPAAM, leads nf-core pipelines like eager and taxprofiler, and drives open science tools for ancient metagenomics, from MEx-IPA to AncientMetagenomeDir and metadata standards like MInAS.

**Jazmin Ramos-Madrigal** is an evolutionary biologist interested in tracing the evolution of plant and animal species through domestication using palaeogenomics. She is an assistant professor at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen. Her work focuses on the study of the evolutionary processes that gave rise to domesticated species and the role that the root microbiome played in plant adaptation during domestication.

**John Robb** is a Professor of European Prehistory at the University of Cambridge. He has conducted fieldwork on the later prehistory of the Central Mediterranean and currently co-leads an interdisciplinary project on medieval Cambridge. His research interests include archaeological and anthropological theory, with a focus on agency, material culture, gender and the body. He also serves as an editor of the Cambridge Archaeological Journal.

**Leo Speidel** (@leospeidel.bsky.social) obtained his PhD from the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, followed by a Sir Henry Wellcome postdoctoral fellowship at UCL and the Francis Crick Institute in London. He is now a group leader at RIKEN, Japan’s national scientific research institute, based at the Center for Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (iTHEMS). He focuses on the development of methods for the inference of genealogies and their applications, such as Relate and Twigstats, to reveal the evolutionary forces that have shaped our DNA, from key events in a nation’s recent past to the earliest days of our species. He will be teaching fstats and how to use Admixtools.

**Selina Carlhoff** is a postdoc at MPI-EVA studying regional connectivity and community structure using archaeogenetics. Her work spans Holocene Southeast Asia to post-Bronze Age Europe, combining lab work, bioinformatics, and archaeological insight.

**Şevval Aktürk** is currently a second-year PhD student in the Bioinformatics Department at Hacettepe University, Türkiye. She completed her master’s in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Middle East Technical University, where she simulated ancient genomes to assess the reliability of genetic relatedness estimation tools. Her doctoral research focuses on analyzing time-series ancient human and microbial DNA data to understand the factors shaping the oral microbiome composition of individuals from Anatolia. As part of her doctoral research, she is also studying the population dynamics of Bronze Age Anatolia.

**Stephan Schiffels** is a group leader for population genetics at the Department for Archaeogenetics of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. His research group at the MPI investigates human history by means of Genetics, and develops computational methods to model and analyse ancient and modern genomic data.
